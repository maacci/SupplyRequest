A client has approached us to develop a system for creating and delivering requests for medical supplies to external vendors. The client has an existing IT system so has requested we provide them with an API which they can use to send these requests. The vendors should be able to use an API to retrieve requests and, in some instances, the client request may target multiple vendors. The recipient vendor or vendors should be included in the API call by the client.  
 
The client also wants to ensure the request has been retrieved by the vendor. As such, a flag should be present in the Client API call which indicates the Vendor acknowledges receipt of the request. The client will also need capability to query if the request has been received and acknowledged by the vendor.
